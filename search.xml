      <content type="text"><![CDATA[ChallengeDon’t think too deep.104.154.187.226/huuuuuge[25 points]Written by Alaska47Initial thoughtsUh. They’re giving us an IP address with an extension (/xxx) which probably means it’s web. But then, why classify this challenge as misc’?Let’s find out.ExploitationFirst of all, let’s fire up nmap and gather information about 104.154.187.226.PORT     STATE  SERVICE VERSION22/tcp   open   ssh     OpenSSH 7.4p1 Debian 10+deb9u3 (protocol 2.0)| ssh-hostkey: |   2048 25:97:23:e0:26:26:07:2e:f6:38:20:90:ce:39:44:96 (RSA)|   256 66:2e:64:31:21:83:68:03:2b:05:30:05:7a:59:72:df (ECDSA)|_  256 25:61:dd:51:b8:43:76:47:ba:96:16:fe:cd:09:e0:04 (ED25519)80/tcp   closed http5901/tcp closed vnc-19418/tcp open   git?Interesting. It’s not a web server after all. I immediately thought that this git opened port was looking weird. Well, let’s try to interact with it.~# git clone 104.154.187.226/huuuuugefatal: repository '104.154.187.226/huuuuuge' does not existErr. Silly me. I forgot the extension, plus : it’s not a web server, so I gotta tell my git where to look and HOW to look.~# git clone git://104.154.187.226/huuuuugeCloning into 'huuuuuge'...remote: Counting objects: 309, done.remote: warning: suboptimal pack - out of memoryremote: fatal: Out of memory, malloc failed (tried to allocate 104857601 bytes)remote: aborting due to possible repository corruption on the remote side.fatal: early EOFfatal: index-pack failedGod damn, this thing is massive! Wait… Challenge name’s Huuuuuge… I see what they did here…Let’s look at git clone’s manual :--depth &lt;depth&gt;Create a shallow clone with a history truncated to the specified number of commits. Implies --single-branch unless --no-single-branch is given to fetch the histories near the tips of all branches. If you want to clone submodules shallowly, also pass --shallow-submodules.Interesting… Let’s try something then, just to see what comes out!~# git clone --depth 1 git://104.154.187.226/huuuuugeCloning into 'huuuuuge'...remote: Counting objects: 3, done.remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)Receiving objects: 100% (3/3), done.Uh, uh! We got the first line. Let’s open it and see what lies for us there.~# cd huuuuuge/~/huuuuuge# lsflag.txtHow nice of them to give us a flag like that! You gotta love TJCTF.The flag was : tjctf{this_fl4g_1s_huuuuuge}After thoughtsVery interesting challenge as I never had encountered this case before of a “too big to clone” git repo. I really like challenges that make you learn new things, and this includes the ones that make you read a command’s manual.]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[The challengeHelp! I lost the password to my Dogecoin wallet. I had like 10 Dogecoin in there. If you get the password, you’ll get the flag! Flag format: tjctf{password}[75 points]Written by Alaska47Initial thoughtsSeeing the name of the challenge, I immediately thought about the infamous rockyou.txt list of passwords. For those of you who don’t know it, it’s this huge list of passwords that was created out of real, leaked passwords.It’s natively present in Kali, check /usr/share/wordlists and you’ll find a rockyou.txt.gz :)So I assumed I’d have to bruteforce this wallet in order to retrieve the password. I googled for “wallet bruteforce” and found glv2’s Github magic thingy.ExploitationFirst off, let’s clone this github repo.~# git clone https://github.com/glv2/bruteforce-walletLet’s install the dependencies required :~# apt install libdb-dev libssl-dev -yLet’s then try to install it following the README’s instructions.~# cd bruteforce-wallet &amp;&amp; ./autogen.sh./autogen.sh: 6: ./autogen.sh: autoreconf: not foundOops! Seems I need to install a package first.~# apt-get install autoconf~# ./autogen.shconfigure.ac:6: installing './compile'configure.ac:2: installing './install-sh'configure.ac:2: installing './missing'Makefile.am: installing './depcomp'Then a ./configure, make and make install and we’re good! Now, let’s use our new little tool :3~# bruteforce-wallet -t 6 -f /root/Documents/rockyou.txt 9d7e6203fb6e2c14646c63bea94e48001b9317c86bec229c3e063904a168dfad_wallet.datWarning: using dictionary mode, ignoring options -b, -e, -l, -m and -s. Tried passwords: 59Tried passwords per second: 59,000000Last tried password: samantha Password found: tinkerbellGot it! Password is “tinkerbell”, hereby flag is : tjctf{tinkerbell}After thoughtsA very basic challenge worth a lot of points compared to other ones in this TJCTF. Still, I enjoyed the five minutes it took me, as I never had to bruteforce a coin-wallet before. Valuable experience!]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[ChallengeThis company’s logo stands in contrast of those of other leading edge tech companies with its poor design[5 points]Written by jfrucht25Initial thoughtsHaving a static .png image with this little amount of points rewarded means it won’t be tough.ExploitationLet’s start with the basics. The “file” command tells us it is indeed a .png. The “binwalk” and “strings” commands give us nothing interesting. Next step? Stegsolve!You can install it here.Here is our beautiful logo :And here is what we can find with just a few switches to the right :Flag : tjctf{in_plain_sight}After thoughtsNot much. This is the very basic of steganography. I’ve encountered it dozens of times in past CTFs.]]></content>
